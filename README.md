# Smart-Watering-Plant-Using-RT-Thread
When the soil moisture sensor detects the change in electrical conductivity it sends data to the controller then with respect to the sensor data the controller switches ON the water pump or switches OFF the water pump. When the water pump is ON led green light is ON, When the water pump is switched OFF the red led is OFF. Thereby the green and red led show the status of the water pump is whether ON or OFF respectively. Threads are used to run tasks concurrently; I have used 3 threads for this project one to monitor the sensor data simultaneously and thread two to turn ON the water pump and green led if the sensor didnâ€™t find any moisture and the thread 3 turns OFF the water pump and turns ON the red led.
